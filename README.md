# FF Spotless

FF Spotless is a mobile-first Laravel checklist application. It runs with PHP 8.3, Laravel 13, Inertia, and MySQL 8.4.

## Local Docker setup

1. Copy the environment template and set strong, unique local values for `APP_KEY`, `DB_PASSWORD`, and `DB_ROOT_PASSWORD`.

   The development-only default admin password is `12345678`. Change
   `CHECKLIST_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env` before sharing the environment,
   deploying, or allowing real users to access the application.

   Keep `DB_TIMEZONE=+00:00` so MySQL stores completion instants in UTC. The UI converts them to Kuala Lumpur time.

   ```powershell
   Copy-Item .env.example .env
   ```

   Generate an application key with Docker, then paste the displayed value into `APP_KEY` in `.env`:

   ```powershell
   docker compose run --rm --no-deps app php -r "echo 'base64:'.base64_encode(random_bytes(32)).PHP_EOL;"
   ```

2. Build and start the app and database:

   ```powershell
   docker compose up --build -d
   ```

3. Apply migrations and verify routes:

   ```powershell
   docker compose exec app php artisan migrate --force
   docker compose exec app php artisan route:list
   ```

The application is available at [http://localhost:8096](http://localhost:8096). MySQL is intentionally bound only to `127.0.0.1:8097`; connect with the database credentials in `.env`.

Useful commands:

```powershell
docker compose logs -f app
docker compose exec app php artisan test
docker compose down
```

`docker compose down -v` also deletes the local MySQL volume and all local checklist data.

## PWA behavior

The manifest and FF Spotless icons are served from `public/`. The Vite PWA build generates the service worker, which precaches only Vite build output and PWA assets. It deliberately never caches navigation, Inertia, authenticated, or POST responses, so checklist reads and writes always reach the server.

The Inertia application registers the Vite-generated service worker and includes the manifest/theme metadata in its root layout. This enables installation only over HTTPS (or `localhost` during development).

## Hostinger deployment

Hostinger Git deployment pulls from the `production` branch. Commit and push
production-ready source changes to that branch before triggering a Hostinger
deploy.

Hostinger SSH on this hosting plan does not support `npm`. After deploying the
Laravel source through Git, build the frontend on a developer machine from the
same commit:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Then upload the complete generated folder through Hostinger File Manager:

```text
public/build/
```

Place it at:

```text
public_html/public/build/
```

Replace the previous `build` folder as a complete folder. Do not copy only
individual hashed files, because the Vite manifest, CSS, JavaScript chunks, and
service worker must all come from the same build.

Keep the Laravel application and secrets outside the web root:

```text
/home/<account>/ffspotless    # complete Laravel application
/home/<account>/private/.env  # permissions: owner read/write only
/home/<account>/public_html   # contents copied from ffspotless/public
```

`public/index.php` detects this layout only when its normal sibling `vendor/` directory is absent, then loads `/home/<account>/ffspotless`. `bootstrap/app.php` automatically uses the sibling `private/.env` when it exists. Do not put `.env`, `vendor/`, `app/`, or `storage/` under `public_html`.

### Build and publish a single release

Build the frontend from the exact application source that will be deployed. Do
not copy individual hashed files into an existing `public/build` directory: an
HTML page, Inertia asset version, and dynamic Dashboard chunk must all come
from the same build.

```bash
cd /home/<account>/ffspotless
npm ci
npm run build
```

Upload or activate the application release and the complete matching
`public/build` directory together. Only after the release is in place, copy the
matching contents of `ffspotless/public` to `public_html` in one deployment
step. Remove no-longer-referenced build files only after the new public files
are active. This prevents browsers from receiving a new page with an old
Dashboard chunk or service worker asset.

After uploading an updated application or changing `private/.env`, run from the application directory:

```bash
php artisan migrate --force
php artisan optimize:clear
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
```

Changing `CHECKLIST_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `private/.env` takes effect after the config cache is rebuilt and PHP has reloaded. Never deploy the development default of `12345678`; replace it with a strong secret in `private/.env`. The password is never stored in the session; the configured session only records successful master-admin authentication.

For production, set `APP_ENV=production`, `APP_DEBUG=false`, a HTTPS `APP_URL`, `SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true`, and `DB_TIMEZONE=+00:00`. Keep `storage/` and `bootstrap/cache/` writable by PHP, and restrict `private/.env` to the hosting account owner.
